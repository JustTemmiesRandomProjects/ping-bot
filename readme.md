this is a bot for spamming a lot of pings

put your token into keys.env

set the owner IDs inside config.json


in order to setup the server, run the --startup command, this will take a minute or two

after this all channels that start with "spam" in their name will be relentlessly pinged :)


NOTE: this is api abuse, don't try making this too much faster, you will most likely get your IP banned for like 30 minutes or something idk
